 - Remote renderer sends 0x0000DEAF, client can then interpret endianness
 - Client sends back 0x0000FEED in correct endianness, the rest is "endian-correct"
 - Client sends two complex coordinates (minre, maxre, minim, maxim)
   - int for sign of numerator
   - int for number of bytes in numerator
   - Count bytes representing the absolute value of the numerator, with least-significant byte first
   - int for number of bytes in denominator
   - Count bytes representing the absolute value of the denominator, LSB first
 - Client sends the rest of the parameters
   - uint iteration count
   - int  width, height
   - int  xOff, xSkip, xMax, yOff, ySkip, yMax
   - uint orbit start, orbit length
   - uint bool (1 is to use bulb checking to optimize fractal, but exludes some orbits, 0 calculates everything)
 - Renderer sends 200 (decimal, OK)
 - Renderer sends back the calculated values
   - int  row number
   - int  number of points (width)
   - For each point x
     - uint iteration count
	 - uint orbit length (number of coordinates following)
	 - Count complex coordinates (real, imaginary) - that means 2 * count rational numbers
	   - int sign of numerator
	   - long count of bytes in numerator
	   - count bytes representing absolute value of numerator, LSB
	   - long count bytes of denominator
	   - count bytes representing abs denominator, LSB
